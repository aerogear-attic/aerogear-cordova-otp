## To install

    cordova create <project-name>

## Example
Copy ``example/*`` into the ``www`` folder of your project and press the OTP button. Initially it will fire up the 
BarcodeScanner to scan a QR code with an url like ``otpauth://totp/username?secret=7SPQJZ7CDF7NTKJ2`` this secret will be 
stored and then later used to generate One Time Passwords have a look at the [guide](http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/AeroGear-OTP/)

Try it on this [demo page](http://controller-aerogear.rhcloud.com/aerogear-controller-demo/login) username is ``john`` and password ``123``

var totp = new AeroGear.Totp();
